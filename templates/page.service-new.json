        "content": "<p>The best way is to start with the best equipment. For that reason, we only recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/au.lamarzocco.com\/about\/la-marzocco-australia\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"La Marzocco Australia Website\">La Marzocco<\/a> espresso machines to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rumblecoffee.com.au\/pages\/wholesale\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rumble Coffee Wholesale Information \">wholesale <\/a>customers. They don’t just make delicious and consistent coffee, but their build quality and value for money are the best in the business. <br\/><\/p><p>We also advise you to buy new coffee machines. Second hand machinery can often be cheaper, but you need to factor in the extra cost of a full service. There are often unexpected issues lurking that you won’t know about until something goes wrong. Recently we bought a secondhand espresso machine for <a href=\"https:\/\/cobbscoffee.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cobb's Coffee Website\">Cobb’s Coffee<\/a> (a La Marzocco PB), gave it a full service and it was going great. Then, six months after we opened, a crack developed in the boiler and it needed a full replacement at a cost of over $3,000.<\/p><p>But, what about <em>(insert hot new coffee machine here)<\/em>? No doubt they make great coffee, but what about their upkeep? How often does a technician visit? How long will they last?<\/p><p>Are the people raving about these machines selling them? Who is paying for the servicing? Take the advice of the barista using them with a grain of salt. Try to talk to whoever bought the machines and pays to service them.<\/p>",
